## Project Description

In this project, I will create my first python-based software!
I will create a TicTacToe game that interacts with the user, using functions and other basic python resources.

## Rules

- The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
- Each grid cell has a number from 0 to 8 as it's coordinate, player must write the number of the cell where he wants to  place each token.
- Each player can place one token for each turn.
- The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
- When all 9 squares are full, the game is over.
- Human Player will always starts first turn.
- The computer opponent will place it's tokens randomly .
